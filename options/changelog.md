## 1.2.1.2

The test framework is changed from `chell` to `hspec`.
This avoids a cyclic dependency between the `options` and `chell` packages.

Various documentation adjustments. Notably, some of the larger parts of the
documentation are moved from the API documentation to a `readme.md` file.

The package is now tested with GHC versions 9.2, 9.4, and 9.6.

Requires an upgrade of the dependency `monads-tf` from `0.1` to `0.3`.
